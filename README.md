# Pressure plates usertests UI
An iterative prototype in the context of my master thesis "Exploration von interaktiven und unaufdringlichen Interfaces in einer semi-public Meetup Situation" (en. "Exploration of interactive and unobtrusive interfaces in a semi-public meetup situation") WS19/30 got created. It consists of two plates lying on the floor, that communicate with each other and present a game.

For the user tests, this python UI got created to easily protocol the user interaction with the prototypes.

The code for the plates (using ESP8266's) can be found [here](https://github.com/binarykittenDE/pressure_plates).

# Thesis
The thesis examines the use of unobtrusive, interactive interfaces in a semi-public meetup situation. The situation "person does not integrate" was selected on the basis of a room situation analysis. Based on this analysis, different prototypes will be iteratively tested in a real meetup situation.
